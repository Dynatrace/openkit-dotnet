# Supported OpenKit .NET versions

The following table gives an overview of supported OpenKit .NET versions.

As OpenKit applies the principles of [semantic versioning][semver] only the latest bugfix
releases are actively maintained for a major-minor version pair.  
Example: Version `1.4.5` supersedes `1.4.4` and therefore only `1.4.5` will be maintained.
